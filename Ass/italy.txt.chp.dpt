italy officially the italian republic italian is a country in europe located in the heart of the mediterranean sea italy shares open land borders with france switzerland austria slovenia san marino and vatican city italy has a largely temperate seasonal and mediterranean climate with around sixty million inhabitants it is the fourth most populous european member state and the most populous country in southern europe due to its central geographic location in europe and the mediterranean italy has historically been home to a myriad of peoples and cultures in addition to the various ancient italian tribes and italic peoples dispersed throughout the italian peninsula and insular italy beginning from the classical era phoenicians carthaginians and greeks established settlements in the south of italy with etruscans and celts inhabiting the centre and the north of italy respectively the italic tribe known as the latins formed the roman kingdom in the fifth century bc which eventually became a republic that conquered and assimilated its neighbours in the first century bc the roman empire emerged as the dominant power in the mediterranean basin and became the leading cultural political and religious centre of western civilisation the legacy of the roman empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law republican governments christianity and the latin scriptduring the early middle ages italy endured sociopolitical collapse and barbarian invasions but by the th century numerous rival citystates and maritime republics mainly in the northern and central regions of italy rose to great prosperity through shipping commerce and banking laying the groundwork for modern capitalism these mostly independent statelets served as europes main trading hubs with asia and the near east often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout europe however part of central italy was under the control of the theocratic papal states while southern italy remained largely feudal until the th century partially as a result of a succession of byzantine arab norman angevin and spanish conquests of the regionthe renaissance began in italy and spread to the rest of europe bringing a renewed interest in humanism science exploration and art italian culture flourished producing famous scholars artists and polymaths such as michelangelo leonardo da vinci raphael galileo and machiavelli during the middle ages italian explorers such as marco polo christopher columbus amerigo vespucci john cabot and giovanni da verrazzano discovered new routes to the far east and the new world helping to usher in the european age of discovery nevertheless italys commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the mediterranean centuries of infighting between the italian citystates such the italian wars of the th and th centuries left the region fragmented and it was subsequently conquered by european powers such as france spain and austriaby the midth century rising italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval after centuries of foreign domination and political division italy was almost entirely unified in  establishing the kingdom of italy as a great power from the late th century to the early th century italy rapidly industrialised namely in the north and acquired a colonial empire while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation fuelling a large and influential diaspora despite being one of the main victors in world war i italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil leading to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in  participation in world war ii on the axis side ended in military defeat economic destruction and the italian civil war following the
